What are web vitals?
Web Vitals are a set of metrics introduced by Google to measure and improve user experience on the web.
They focus on key aspects of website performance, including loading speed, interactivity, and visual stability.
The core Web Vitals are:

Largest Contentful Paint (LCP): Measures loading performance.
First Input Delay (FID): Measures interactivity.
Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS): Measures visual stability.

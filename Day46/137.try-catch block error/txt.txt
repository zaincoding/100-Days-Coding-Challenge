The 'try' block is used to encapsulate the code that may generate an error inside the function a variable 'name' is declared and assigned the value 'myFunction' so it wraps the code which is used to call the function called 'myFunction' if it throws an error during execution then the normal execution will be interrupted and control will be transferred to the 'catch(error)' block. Then the catch block will handle the error by accepting the 'error' parameter as an object that contains the error information and its message

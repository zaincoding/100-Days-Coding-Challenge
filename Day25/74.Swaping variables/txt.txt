the code is used to initialize two variable 'a' with value '5' and 'b' with value '10' to swape their values a third variable 'c' is declared 
first the value of b which is '10' stored in 'c' variable then the value of 'a' variable which is '5' assigned to the 'b' variable then the
the value of 'c' assigned to 'a' which make the swap possible.so the 'c' variable has a key role in swaping.

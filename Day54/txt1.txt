Working with variable:
Declare two variables: admin and name.
Assign the value "John" to name.
Copy the value from name to admin.
Show the value of admin using alert (must output “John”).

Giving the right name:
1.Create a variable with the name of our planet. How would you name such a variable?
2.Create a variable to store the name of a current visitor to a website. How would you name that variable?

Uppercase const?
Upper case is used for constant when the value is already know or hardcoded.or the vlaue know preior
to execution and directly wirtten inot the code.

age is constant in a sence that it will not change through the code execution but after a yerar
the birth date will be change. so the year should be written in lower case.

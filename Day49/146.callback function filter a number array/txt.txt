'anArray' of number is defined and then called the '.filter()' method on 'anArry' to filter the numbers which pass the
test implemented by callback function 'number', inside the filter() method an arrow function 'number => number > 4' which
is called also called call back function is provided. it tests the provided array number if it is greater than 4 it
returns 'true' and includes the number in the filter array, if it is less than 4 it returns false indicating it is excluded from
the array. the filter array will be assigned to the 'filterNumber' and finally logged to the console.

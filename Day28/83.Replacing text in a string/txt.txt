In this code we defined two variables with types string and both have string value text.we print the original string of first variable,
then we print the string to replace 'Hello' with 'Hi' by using the 'text.replace("Hello","Hi")' replace() method.

In the second variable first we print the original string and then we print the string to replace 'white' with 'brown' using /white/g will replace 
all occurances of 'white' with 'brown' in the input string. But it won't modifiy the original string.

In this code we define a variable 'theString' and assign value as a string which contains the text 'Today is Friday' then we make a function that takes one parameter 'characters'. The function is designed to calculate the length of a string passed to it. inside the function, the 'characters.length' returns the length of the string. at the end we call the function passed 'theString' as an argument to get its length.

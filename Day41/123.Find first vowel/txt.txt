In this code we use the 'for loop' to initialize 'i; value '0', and check if the 'i' is less than the length value of str 'i<str.length, i++ increment 'i' by one character in each iteration. then using the if condition to check if the current character of 'str' is equal to 'a', if the current value of str === 'a' is true, the break statement is executed. It will terminate the loop, and exit the loop.

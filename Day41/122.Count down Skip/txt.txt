In this code we use the 'for loop' to initialize 'i' with value '10' then check the condition 'i > 0; and decrement 'i' by 1 in each iteration. Furthermore, we use the if statement to check if the current value of i is equal to '5' if the condition i===5 is true the 'break' statement will be executed, and it will terminate and exit the loop. Finally, it will print the value from 10 to 6 in reverse order.

In this code we use the for loop to initialize 'i' with value '1' then use the condition 'i<=10' to check 'i' is less than ten,'i++' increment 'i' by 1 in each iteration. Then we use the if condition to check if the current value of 'i' is equal to '5' if condition 'i===5' is true then the continue statement will be executed. which will skip the current iteration 'i' value '5' and move to the next iteration. Finally, it will print the value from 1 to 10 without the value '5' iteration.

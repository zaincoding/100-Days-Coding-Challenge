In this code we declare a variable named 'text' its type string and initialize with the value"I would like to have a cup of tea" and we define another constant variable text1, assign the extracted value portation of the 'text' string by calling the '.substring()' method with two arguments.

'0' is the starting index and '12' is the ending index of the substring it means that the extraction should start from the character 0 and end before the character 12.

At the end, you can see the result of both the strings. The original string 'text' and the modified string 'text1'

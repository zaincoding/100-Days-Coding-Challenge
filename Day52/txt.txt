Introduction to javascript:



What is javascript?

Javascript was initially created to 'make web pages alive'



the programs in a javascript language called scripts. javascript code doesn't need to compile it can be written

in HTML code and automatically run as the page loaded.



Why is it called JavaScript?

When JavaScript was initially created it was called "LiveScript" but Java was very popular then.

it was decided that positioning it with 'java as its younger brother' would help to gain popularity.

but with time javascript evolved and became a fully independent language with its specification

called "ECMAScript" and it has no relation to Java.



Now Javascript executes on browsers, servers, and on any other devices that have a special program called 'the javaScript Engine'.



the browser has an embedded system sometimes called javascript "javascript virtual machine"



Different engines have different "Codenames".For example.



* V8 - in Chrome, Opera, and Edge.

* SpiderMonkey - in Firefox.



There are some other codenames like "Chakra" for IE, "JavaScriptCore", "Nitro" and "squirrelFish" for Safari, etc.



How Engine Work:

Basics about engine work.



1. the engine(embeded if it is a browser)reads("parses")Scripts.

2. Then it converts("compiles") the script to machine code.

3. Add then the machine code runs, pretty fast.





What can in-browser JavaScript do?



JavaScript does anything related to webpage manipulation, user interaction, and web server.



1. it can add a new HTML page, change the existing content, and modify the style.

2. react to a user action, run on mouse click, pointer movement, and key press.

3. send a request to the remote server, download and upload files.

4. get and set cookies.

5. remember client-side data







What can't in-browser JavaScript do?

in the browser, its abilities are limited to protect user safety. The purpose is to prevent evil web pages from

accessing user data.



Examples of such restrictions:

it may not read/write arbitrary files on a hard disk, copy or execute. and no direct access to the OS function.



modern browsers provide limited access but it depends on the user doing certain actions. like 'dropping file' in the browser window and or selecting

via user <input> tag.



There are also certain ways to interact with, the camera, microphone, and other devices but it depends on user permission



for user safety, it prevents a webpage with one url example http://oneurl.com opened by the user to access another URL http://urltwo.com to steal 

user data.



javascript can easily communicate with the server but its ability to receive data from other sites/domains is crippled for user safety.





Uniques of javascript



*integrate with HTML/CSS

*Supported by all major browsers and enabled by default

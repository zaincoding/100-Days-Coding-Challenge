In this code, we defined an object called 'myObject' with property(name, age, email, and its type) assigned value string and number

we converted the javascript object to the JSON string using 'JSON.stringify(myobject) method and log the result to the console.

finally, as the second parameter represents a replacer function we are not using a replacer function so pass 'null', and for indentation, 

we use the third parameter '4' which specifies the number of spaces to use for indentation.

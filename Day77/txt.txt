SSL vs TLS vs SSH Protocols:

SSL (Secure Sockets Layer): An older cryptographic protocol designed to provide secure communication over a computer network.
 It has been deprecated in favor of TLS due to various security vulnerabilities.

TLS (Transport Layer Security): The successor to SSL, TLS provides enhanced security for data transmission over networks.
 It ensures privacy and data integrity between communicating applications.

SSH (Secure Shell): A protocol for secure remote login and other secure network services over an unsecured network.
 It uses encryption to protect the confidentiality and integrity of data exchanged between the client and the server.

DNS & DHCP

DNS
The Domain Name System (DNS) is a system that translates human-readable domain names (like www.example.com) into numerical IP addresses (like 192.168.1.1),
 enabling browsers to locate and access websites on the internet. 
It acts like a phonebook for the internet, simplifying navigation and connectivity for users.

DHCP

DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) is a network management protocol used to automate the process of configuring devices on IP networks.
 It allows devices to automatically receive an IP address and other network configuration parameters, such as the default gateway and DNS server, 
enabling them to communicate on the network without manual setup.

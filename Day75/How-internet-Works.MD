What is internet?

Internet is a global network of computer conneted to each other which communicate through a standardized
set of protocols.

How does the information move on the internet?
Wires, cables, and Wi-Fi

Information moves form one computer to another computer in the form of bits over various mediums,
fiber optic cables, wirless signals(i.e radio waves)

How do the networks talk to each other and the protocols involved?

IP Address & DNS

An IP (Internet Protocol) address is a unique numerical label assigned to each device connected to a computer network that uses the IP for communication.
Types:
1.IPv4:
*32-bit address format.
2.IPv6:
*128-bit address format.

DNS
The Domain Name System (DNS) is a system that translates human-readable domain names (like www.example.com) into numerical IP addresses (like 192.168.1.1),
 enabling browsers to locate and access websites on the internet. 
It acts like a phonebook for the internet, simplifying navigation and connectivity for users.


What’s the relationship between packets, routers, and reliability?
Packets, Routing, and Reliability
Packets
Packets are small units of data that are transmitted over a network. Each packet contains a portion of the overall data, 
along with metadata such as source and destination addresses and error-checking information.

Routing
Routing is the process of determining the optimal path for packets to travel from the source to the destination across a network. 
Routers, which are network devices, use routing tables and protocols to direct packets along the most efficient routes.

Reliability
Reliability in networking refers to the assurance that data is delivered accurately and in the correct order.
 Protocols like TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) provide reliability by establishing connections, managing data retransmissions,
 and ensuring error-free delivery of packets.




HTTP and the HTML – How are you viewing this webpage in your browser?

HTTP
HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is the protocol used for transmitting web pages over the internet. When you enter a URL in your browser, an HTTP request is sent to the web server, which then responds with the requested web page's data.

HTML
HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the standard language used to create and format web pages. It structures the content and layout of a web page using tags and elements.

Viewing a Webpage
Enter URL: You type a URL into your browser's address bar.
HTTP Request: The browser sends an HTTP request to the web server.
Server Response: The server responds with HTML data and possibly other resources like CSS and JavaScript files.
Rendering: The browser parses the HTML and other resources, rendering the web page for you to view and interact with.




How is the information transfer on the internet made secure?

Encryption
Encryption is the process of converting plain text into a coded form (ciphertext) to prevent unauthorized access. It ensures that only authorized parties can read the data by using an encryption algorithm and a key.

Public Key
Public Key is part of a pair of keys used in asymmetric encryption. The public key is openly shared and used to encrypt data, while the corresponding private key is kept secret and used to decrypt the data. This ensures secure communication, 
as only the holder of the private key can decrypt the data encrypted with the public key.


Cybersecurity
Cybersecurity is the practice of protecting computers, networks, and data from unauthorized access, damage, theft, and other cyber threats. It involves implementing security measures, protocols, and technologies to safeguard digital assets.


What is cybersecurity and what are some common internet crimes?

Common Internet Crimes
Phishing: Fraudulent attempts to obtain sensitive information by pretending to be a trustworthy entity in electronic communications.
Malware: Malicious software designed to damage, disrupt, or gain unauthorized access to computer systems.
Ransomware: A type of malware that encrypts a victim's data and demands payment for the decryption key.
Identity Theft: Stealing personal information to impersonate someone and commit fraud.
Hacking: Unauthorized access to computer systems to steal, alter, or destroy data.

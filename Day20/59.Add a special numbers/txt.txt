Import 'inquirer' command is used to import the inquirer library,which allow us to prompt the user input in node.js
invironment.Next we declare a variable 'adder' and assigned value 10 ,which will be added to the user input.

the inquirer.prompt() function will display a 'message' to the user and be wait for it's response.the response will
be stored in 'answer' object. later one we will extract the the user input from the answer object and will store 
in a variable, then we will use a condtition to check the user input, if it is a valid value it
will be added to the predefined variable and printed to output the result.

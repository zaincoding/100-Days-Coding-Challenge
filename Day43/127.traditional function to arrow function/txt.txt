In this code, we defined a traditional function called 'trdFunction' that takes two parameters such as 'p1' and 'p2' both of type 'number' furthermore
inside the p1*p2 are multiplied and its result is returned. Finally, call the function 'trFunction' and output the result to the console.

The second function is an arrow function called 'arrowFunction that also takes two parameters as 'p1' and 'p2' both of type 'number' furthermore
inside the function p1, p2 are multiplied and its result is returned, Finally, the result is logged to the console.

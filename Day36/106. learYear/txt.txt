In this code we created a function called 'isLeapYear' with its type 'boolean' inside the block code of the function we used the && and OR conditions to check that the variable year is divisible by 4 and not divisible by 100 or divisible by 400 if either condition is true, the year is a leap year, so return true, otherwise false. finally, we called the function by passing the arguments to output the result to the console.

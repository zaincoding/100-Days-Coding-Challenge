In this code, we use three reserved words(class, function, if) and create a valid use case for each.

 using class:

we defined the class name 'personName' with a constructor and a person() method to create an instance of the class

and call the person() method to retrieve the person name. 



using function:

We defined a function called 'person' that takes the 'firstName' parameter and returns the first name.



Using if:

if is used to execute the block code when a specific condition is true.in this code, we defined

two variables a and b, and assigned their values. then using the if condition that if a is greater than b

execute the if block of code, otherwise else so it will execute the if block as a is greater than b.

In this code, we created a guessing number game that takes command line user input and matches it with the computer-generated number if the user input and computer-generated random match it will be true otherwise it will repeatedly call the function and allow the user to guess again.
So here we used the 'await' keyword in the 'match()' function to handle the asynchronous so the await is used to wait for the user's response and in case of an incorrect guess the 'async match()' function allows the user recursively to make another guess.

In this program we have a Laptop arry which contain three objects of different laptops.
then use array destructuring to extract first and third elements of the laptop array and assign
them to firstlatop and thirdlapton variables.then log to the console these variables.

we use ,, double commas in the destructuring pattern[firstlaptop , , secondlaptop]
which indicate empty space between these two commas which skip the second laptop.

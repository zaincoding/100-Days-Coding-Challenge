In this code, we defined an object called 'person' with the 'name' property and 'objProp' method. we assigned the string value 'Samad' to the name property of the 'person', 'objProp' method is used within the object. Inside the 'objProp' method we use the 'this.name' which refers to the object property 'name' and print the person's name. Furthermore, we defined 'NestedFunction' inside the 'object' method we call it from inside the 'object' method. Inside the 'NestedFunction' 'this' does not refer to the 'person' object.it's referring to 'undefined' in strict mode or refers to the global object otherwise. Therefore attempting to access 'this.name' inside 'NestedFunction' will result in 'undefined'

ins strict mode or the global object 'name'.Finally, we call the 'objProp' method of the person object to print the result.

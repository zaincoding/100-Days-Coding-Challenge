In this code, we defined an object called 'personObject' with 'name', 'age' properties, and the 'objProp' method.
we assigned string value 'Sammad' to the name property and assigned number value 30 to the age property of the 'personObject'
the 'objPop' is used as a function inside the 'personObject' to return the 'name' and 'age' properties of the object. finally, we called the function 'objProp' of the 'personObject' to print the name and age property.

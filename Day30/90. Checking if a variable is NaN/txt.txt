In this code we defined a function named 'checkisNaN()' that takes one parameter 'check' This function is designed to check that the data is not a number as 'One two three' is not a number base value it's letter base value so it will return true. if the data is a number base such as '123' it will return false as the data type is a string but the value is number base if the data is a number base such as 123 it will return false as the data type is number and value is number base.

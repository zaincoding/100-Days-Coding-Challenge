I created a function named 'decimalNumber' that takes one parameter named 'deci' this function is designed to round up the decimal number to its nearest integer for example '5.4' rounds up to '5' and '5.6' rounds up to 6. for rounding up the value to it's nearest integer we used the 'Math.round() method inside the function and use the return keyword which returns the final value. In the end, we called the function 'decimalNumber' with an argument '5.50' to log its result to the console.

In this code we used two functions one is 'Function Declaration' another 'Function Expression' the function declaration
named 'funDec' takes one paramter 'square' it's type number and return the square.The interesting thing is that you can call it before the declaration with in the scope

The function expression named 'Exp' also take one paramter 'cube' it's type number and return cube.but it is not accessible before the declaration if try to do it
it will generate an error as you can see in the code.

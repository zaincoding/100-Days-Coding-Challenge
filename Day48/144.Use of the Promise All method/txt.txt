In this code, we create the promise array 'promises' contains three promises the two promises are resolved immediately 

with string values 'promise 1 resolve' and 'promise 2 resolve' using the 'promise.resolve' method, the third 'new Promise()' create a new promise and 'setTimeout()' delays the promise to resolve with the string value 'Hello, World' after 3 seconds. the 'promise.all(promises) method calls that create a new promise and resolve when all promises in the 'promises' have been resolved or rejected if any of the promises is rejected.





'promise.all(),if all the promises in the '(promises)'array resolve successfully

the callback function passed to the .then()method with an array of resolved value('output'). it logs 'All promises resolved' followed by the array resolved value('output).



'promise.all(),if any of the promises in the '(promises)' array is rejected

the callback function passed to the .catch() is invoked with an error. It logs 'At least one promise rejected' followed by the error to the console.

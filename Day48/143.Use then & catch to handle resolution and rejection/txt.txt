In this code we create the promise 'deayTime' using the Promise constructor, 'new Promise(...) is the promise constructor to create a new object.
it type 'promise<string> which resolves with the string value. the promise constructor takes the executor function as its argument,'((resolve,reject))=>{...}) is an executor function, this function is immediately invoked by the constructor it receives two parameters 'resolve' and 'reject'. Inside the executor function 'setTimeout()' is used to delay 3000 milliseconds(3second)
after the delay a random number is generated('randomNumber') if it is less than 3 the promise is resolved with the string value 'Hellow, World', otherwise the promise is rejected with an 'Error' object containing the message 'An error occurred'.

A promise 'delayTime' resolves with the string value 'Hello, World' after the delay of 3sec. Using '.then()' method to handle the resolved value of the promise. A call back function(message) =>{} with parameter 'message' is
passed to the '.then()'. log the resolved message to the console when the promise is fulfilled.

A promise 'delayTime' rejects with an error after the delay of 3sec.
Use the '.catch()' method to handle any promise error. A callback function passed to '.catch()'. log the rejected error message to the console when the promise is rejected.

In this code we defined a month function 'monthSeason' takes the 'month' as a parameter which represents the month number. The switch statement evaluates the value of 'month using a 'switch' statement to determine the season, each 'case' represents block groups of multiple months together as the first case contains (case 12, case 1, case 2) which represents the 'winter' season similarly the next block groups of month representing spring. The 'break' statement terminates the current case and excites the switch statement. If no case is matched the default case will be executed. Finally, Output the result of the function 'monthSeason' to the console.

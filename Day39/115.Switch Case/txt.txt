Using the switch statement, we first declared a variable without assigning any value that will be used later on to store the day of the week. then we use the 'switch' statement to evaluate the result of 'new Date().getDay() which will return the day of the week as the number '0' represents 'Sunday' and the number '6' represents 'Saturday' furthermore the switch statement allows to execute the required block based on the condition matching. Each case handles a specific day of the week. The break statement exits the switch statement after executing the code inside the 'case' block. if the value returned by 'new Date().getDay() does not match any of 'cases' from 0 to 6 then the 'default' case will be executed. Finally the Output of the 'day' will print the current day of the week.

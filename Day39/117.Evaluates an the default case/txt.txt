In this code we declare 'day' and assign the value '3' then we evaluate the value of the day in the switch statement, and then we use three cases the first case is '0' if the day is set to '0' evaluate the first case the second case is '1' if the day is set to '1'  evaluate the second case, similarly, in the third case is '2' if the day is set to '2' value the third case, if no case matches to the value of the day then execute the default case. finally, we executed the default statement as the value of the day is set to '3' so there is no case match.

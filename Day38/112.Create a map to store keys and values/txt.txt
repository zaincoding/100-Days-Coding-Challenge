In this code Map is defined 'countryCapital' to store country and capital value moreover its keys and values types are string as 'key' represents 'countries' and 'value' represents 'capitals then we use the 'set' method to add key-value to the map. Each call to '.set()' method adds a new entry with a key as a country and value as a capital. Finally, we logged the Map 'countryCapital' variable to the console, which will display the stored country-capital in the map.

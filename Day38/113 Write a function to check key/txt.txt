In this code, we created a new Map called 'countryCapital' to store country-capital pairs. Both the keys-values are strings then we used the 'set' method to add keys(country) and value (capital) to the map. next, we use the function called 'countryCaps'  that takes a parameter 'country' and its type string, inside the function we use the '.has()' method to check that the specific country exists in the map 'countryCapital', we use the .get() method to return that country's capital if the condition is true if it does not exist then return 'undefined'.
